# TweetStormInSolr

This is a sample project for someone trying to bring twitter data in to solr using apache Storm and show it in dashboards.

This is built using maven so that you can easily download and extend or you can contribute to it too and take it further.

This project only shows the code to collect the data in solr but the dashboarding can be done by using Lucidworks Banana project on top of solr.
